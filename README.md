This is an HTML/CSS demo business web-app project as of right now, and soon it'll have the trifecta mix: HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
Later on, I might further develop this web-app by converting it into a Fullstack project. I'm going to add more layers to this
project then I'll be adding some JavaScript. I haven't learned JavaScript yet, soon I'll be learning it. Currently, I am 
focusing on developing my HTML/CSS skills to find further stability and comfortability.
