Hi, my name is Yuri. Recently, I've been making these type of projects for fun. 
This is one whereas of right now, it's just a HTML/CSS web-page. 
I'm going to add more layers to the web-page, then I'll be adding some JavaScript to the mix. 
I haven't learned JavaScript yet, soon I'll be learning it, and finally adding it to the web-page.
Currently, I am focusing on developing my HTML/CSS skills to find more stability and comfortability.
