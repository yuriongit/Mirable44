<h1>Mirable44 - Business Demo Business Web-App Project</h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2>
A supposed "IDE Editor Program"; this is just a prop site (that being so, I used VSCode for demo photos). This is an HTML/CSS demo business web-app project as of right now, and soon it'll have the trifecta mix: HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
Later on, I might further develop this web-app by converting it into a Fullstack project. I'm going to add more layers to this
project then I'll be adding some JavaScript. I haven't learned JavaScript yet, soon I'll be learning it. Currently, I am 
focusing on developing my HTML/CSS skills to find further stability and comfortability.
